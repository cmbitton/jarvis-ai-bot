## <u>ChatGPT Instructions</u></b>

ChatGPT is a large language model chatbot, trained to understand natural language and generate human-like responses. ChatGPT is enabled by default, so any message sent to Jarvis that does not start with a keyword will be processed by ChatGPT. ChatGPT has the ability to remember what was said throughout a conversation. To end a conversation, you must reply "chatgpt exit". A new conversation will automatically be started the next time you use ChatGPT.

Jarvis also comes equipped with ChatGPT "Pre-Prompts". These Pre-Prompts are activated by a keyword when starting a new conversation. The Pre-Prompts add character and personality to ChatGPT, and can help unlock various features and abilities. To use a preprompt, start a new conversation by replying with "chatgpt exit". Your first message of the new conversation should
start with the preprompt that you want to use. You do not need to repeat the preprompt for subsequent messages.

<b>ChatGPT PrePrompt Example:</b>

<b>First Message of new conversation:</b> "/hulkhogan Hello, what's up" <br>
<b>Response:</b> "Let me tell you something, brother! I'm doing great, just living that Hulkamania lifestyle and getting ready to slam
some big time opponents in the ring. What's shaking with you, dude?
