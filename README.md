ChatGPT is a large language model chatbot, trained to understand natural language and generate human-like responses. ChatGPT is enabled by default, so any message sent to Jarvis that does not start with a keyword will be processed by ChatGPT. ChatGPT has the ability to remember what was said throughout a conversation. To end a conversation, you must reply "chatgpt exit". A new conversation will automatically be started the next time you use ChatGPT.

Jarvis also comes equipped with ChatGPT "Pre-Prompts". These Pre-Prompts are activated by a keyword when starting a new conversation. The Pre-Prompts add character and personality to ChatGPT, and can help unlock various features and abilities.
