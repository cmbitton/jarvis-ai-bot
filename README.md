Stable Diffusion is a text to image model, capable of producing new high quality images from a text description. <br>

## <u>ChatGPT Instructions</u></b>

ChatGPT is a large language model chatbot, trained to understand natural language and generate human-like responses. ChatGPT is enabled by default, so any message sent to Jarvis that does not start with a keyword will be processed by ChatGPT. ChatGPT has the ability to remember what was said throughout a conversation. To end a conversation, you must reply "chatgpt exit". A new conversation will automatically be started the next time you use ChatGPT.

Jarvis also comes equipped with ChatGPT "Pre-Prompts". These Pre-Prompts are activated by a keyword, and are most best used when starting a new conversation. Using a Pre-Prompt on an existing conversdation may result in unwanted behavior, due to the conflicting conversation history. Pre-Prompts add character and personality to ChatGPT, and can help unlock various features and abilities. To use a Pre-Prompt, start a new conversation by replying with "chatgpt exit". Your first message of the new conversation should
contain the Pre-Prompt that you want to use. You do not need to repeat the Pre-Prompt for subsequent messages.

--------------------------------------------
### <u><b>ChatGPT Pre-Prompt Example and Keywords:</b></u>

<b>First Message of new conversation:</b> "/hulkhogan Hello, what's up" <br>
<b>Response:</b> "Let me tell you something, brother! I'm doing great, just living that Hulkamania lifestyle and getting ready to slam
some big time opponents in the ring. What's shaking with you, dude?


### <b><u>ChatGPT Pre-Prompt Keywords (best used on new conversations):</u></b><br><br>

### <u><b>GPT-4 Support</b></u>

As of 3/25, Jarvis now has the ability to switch between the following models: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. GPT-3.5 is the default model, and is capable for most situations. GPT-4 is slower and much more expensive than GPT-3.5, but provides better responses for certain prompts, such as advanced logic and reasoning. <br><br>
To use GPT-4, start your message with the following Pre-Prompt: /gpt4 <br>
To switch back to GPT-3.5, start your message with the following Pre-Prompt: /chatgpt <br><br>

You can switch back and forth between models as many times as you like within a conversation without losing conversation history. You do not need to repeat the Pre-Prompt for subsequent messages, as Jarvis will remember the current model that you chose. If you do not provide a model pre-prompt at the start of a conversation, GPT-3.5 will be used as the default.

<b>NOTE:</b> If you are using a model Pre-Prompt in conjuction with another Pre-Prompt (celebrity/character/personality), you MUST put the model Pre-Prompt first.<br>

<b>Example: </b><br>
<b>First Message of new conversation:</b> "/gpt4 /hulkhogan Hello, what's up" <br>
